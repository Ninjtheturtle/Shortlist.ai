**Shortlist.ai** is an AI-powered hiring pipeline that automates resume screening, voice-based interviews, and candidate ranking â€” helping recruiters identify top talent faster and more accurately.

## ðŸš¨ Problem

Recruiters face application overload. Traditional ATS systems rely on keyword filters that discard qualified candidates due to phrasing mismatches. This results in longer hiring cycles, missed opportunities, and inefficient screening.

- **Scoring & Ranking**: Applicants are scored (1â€“10) using AI-driven analysis of interview transcripts and background check results.
- **Recruiter Dashboard**: Ranked candidates, full transcripts, and summaries are delivered in a clean, self-serve dashboard.
